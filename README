A python adapter to easily work with the Yahoo CSV API

The if __name__ == "__main__" part should give you an idea how to work with it.

It's a component of a larger project I'm working on, but I thought it was useful.
Thought I would put it out there.  It's the first one I went to the trouble of making 10/10 with pylint.
